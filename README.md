# Eachine H8 mini level firmware

This is a dual mode version of the firmware for Eachine H8 mini / JJRC H8 mini.

The firmware uses cascaded pids in level mode.


For accelerometer calibration move the pitch stick down 3 times within about 1- 2 seconds. Wait a couple of seconds between attempts. Throttle has to be low, and roll centered. Flashing lights indicate the calibration process. This is saved so it has to be done only once.

To set / reset AUX1 channel use left - left - down (off) or right - right - down (on). The leds flash if a gesture is detected.

Do not switch level mode on while upside down.
