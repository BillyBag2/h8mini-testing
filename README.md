# Eachine H8 mini level firmware

This is a dual mode version of the firmware for Eachine H8 mini / JJRC H8 mini.

The firmware uses cascaded pids in level mode.

For accelerometer calibration hold left yaw (over 90%) for 5 seconds with throttle at minimum, in level mode, with pitch and roll stick(s)  centered. Flashing lights indicate the calibration process. This is saved so it has to be done only once.

Do not switch level mode on while upside down.

### Update 12.11.15
