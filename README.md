# Eachine H8 mini level firmware

This is a testing version of the firmware for H8 mini.

The firmware uses cascaded pid's.

For accelerometer calibration hold left yaw (over 90%) for 5 seconds with throttle at minimum, in level mode, with pitch and roll stick(s)  centered. Flashing lights indicate the calibration process. This is saved so it has to be done only once.

Do not switch level mode on while upside down.
